7. What are some of the mentoring issues raised by this case?

While reading this case study Donald Green was the mentor for Michael LaCour for his so called experiment. Green said to RetractionWatch 
that when Michael presented his first survey results to him he said he was so astonished that the findings would only be credible if another replica experiment was done and once Michael and Dave did the experiment again the results were the same as the first trial, but Green should have been there for both the trials so he can see how the experiment was done was he never was there to supervise the procedure which is bad mentorship especially when dealing with a research experiment.


11. What are some lessons learned from this case?

One lesson learned from this case is to always be supervised by your research mentor. Your research mentor should always be present when you are conducting your research they are there to support you with whatever you need and another lesson learned from this case is to make sure the person you are working with actually knows how to conduct a full fledged research do not have a long distance collaboration with anyone because you are not sure if they are holding up their end of the research, they can easily be manipulating the data just like Michael did with this case study.
