##What are some lessons learned from this case?

The lessons that were taken away from the research were the lack of making sure that the data collected wasn’t tampered with. Meaning that the reviewer of the project needs to double if not triple check that the data was accurately collected and recorded. Another lesson that was taken away is to oversee that all funding’s for the project are legitimate and are distributed as said in the research and not in a different way. In this research LaCour lied by saying he gave each participant $100 when he had entered them in a raffle instead for an Apple product because he didn’t have the funding’s that he claimed to have. 


## What data management issues does this case raise?
	
Some issues that arisen were that the data was tampered with to make the outcome of the results be astonishing and unique to the point that it was significate. The data management should have been looking for discrepancies that had occurred in the data instead of letting the researcher do everything on their own without getting verified about all the work done. There was lack in control and verification in the research which laid to the retraction of the research.
