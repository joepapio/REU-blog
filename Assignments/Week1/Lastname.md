## Background:

As we start thinking about the application of statistics in forensics this summer, consider [this podcast](http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/theres-less-science-in-forensic-science-than-you-think/), from Science Friday a few weeks ago. Write a short response (maybe 4-5 paragraphs), responding to the podcast and the following questions:

Does what the guests on the show say surprise you? Why or why not? If you've taken courses in forensics, do you agree with their assessments? Summarize your position briefly. 

If you were being tried for a crime, would you have faith that the evidence would be weighed fairly and honestly? Explain that belief. Based on their commentary, what forms of evidence do you think hold up to scrutiny, and which do not? Justify your responses.

Do you think the criminal justice system is living up to the idea of "innocent until **proven** guilty"? Support your opinion with ideas or quotes from the podcast.

## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
